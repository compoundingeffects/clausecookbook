## Amendment (Customer Favorable)
Modifications or additions to this agreement are only valid if they are in written form and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. These modifications must specifically reference the part of the agreement that they are changing or supplementing. Each party agrees to disregard any terms found in other documents related to this transaction, such as quotes, order forms, invoices, purchase orders, and statements of work, if those terms differ from or add to the terms of this agreement. The only exceptions are terms in those documents that specify (a) the names and descriptions of the products or services being sold or provided, (b) the prices of the products and fees for the services, (c) the duration for which the products or services will be provided, (d) the terms of delivery or shipping, and (e) the contact information of the parties involved.

## Amendment (Vendor Favorable)
This agreement may only be supplemented, modified, or amended if the changes are in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party to this agreement. The terms and conditions of this agreement will take precedence over any terms in purchase orders or other business forms used by the customer.

If there is a disagreement related to this agreement, it will be resolved by a binding arbitration process in [City] [State] under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision from this process may be enforced in any appropriate court.

## Assignment (Mutual Restriction)
Neither party may transfer any of their rights or delegate any of their obligations under this agreement without the other's prior written consent. Any attempt to do so without this consent is invalid. However, consent is not required if a party transfers this agreement to: (a) an affiliate, (b) an entity remaining after a merger or sale, or (c) an entity that acquires the entirety or substantial majority of the party's assets. This agreement remains binding for both parties and any future entities that take their place or are approved for transfer.
## Assignment (One-Sided Restriction)
Party A may not transfer this agreement to another party without Party B's written consent. However, if Party A has a successor or is allowed to transfer the agreement, the successor(s) or transferee(s) will also be bound by this agreement. Party B may transfer this agreement to another party without any restrictions.

## Counsel
Each party had its own legal representation when discussing and preparing this agreement. As a result, all parties waive any legal rule that might otherwise apply to the interpretation of this agreement, particularly any legal rule suggesting that ambiguities should be resolved against the party responsible for drafting the agreement.
## Counterparts
This agreement may be signed in separate parts, each of which will be considered an original and, when combined, will form one complete agreement. Each part may be sent electronically.
## Electronic Signatures
This agreement is valid with electronic signatures. Each party, by signing electronically, agrees that these signatures legally bind them and are equally valid, enforceable, and admissible as handwritten signatures.

## Entire Agreement (Neutral)
This agreement, including its exhibits, statements of work, and order forms, represents the complete agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter. It replaces all previous agreements and understandings, whether spoken or written, between the parties about this subject.

## Entire Agreement (Vendor Favorable)
This agreement, along with its attachments and any addenda signed by both parties, is the complete and exclusive understanding between them concerning its subject matter. It supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings, and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties on this topic. Terms, provisions, or conditions in any purchase orders, acknowledgments, or other business documents used by either party concerning the transactions under this agreement will not affect or change the rights, duties, or obligations of the parties as stated in this agreement. This remains true even if the receiving party does not object to these terms, provisions, or conditions.

## Exhibits
*This clause ensures that all exhibits mentioned in the agreement are legally part of the agreement, as if they were fully included within the text each time they are referenced.*

Every exhibit mentioned or referred to in this agreement is attached to this agreement. Each exhibit is incorporated into this agreement by reference or mention at each instance where it is referred to or mentioned. This incorporation is as effective as if the exhibit were fully presented in detail each time it is referenced or mentioned.

## Force Majeure (Customer Favorable)
Neither party will be considered to have breached their obligations if their failure or delay in performance is due to circumstances outside their reasonable control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, natural disasters (like earthquakes, floods, and fires), acts of God, war, terrorism, and strikes, which are collectively known as force majeure events.

## Force Majeure (Vendor Favorable)
Except for the obligation to make payments, neither the vendor nor the customer will be responsible for failing to perform their duties if this failure is due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, riots, labor-related issues, actions taken by the government, or problems with the Internet.

## Governing Law (International)
This agreement will not be governed by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Instead, it will follow the laws of [State], including its Uniform Commercial Code, without considering any conflicting state laws. 
## Governing Law and Jurisdiction (Customer Favorable)
This agreement and any related disputes, including non-contractual claims, will be governed by the laws of the state where the customer is located and the United States, ignoring conflict of law rules. All actions or claims connected to this agreement will be exclusively handled by the state and federal courts in the customer's county. Each party agrees to this exclusive jurisdiction and (a) waives any objections to the location or convenience of these courts, and (b) agrees not to start proceedings related to this agreement in any other court or forum.
## Governing Law and Jurisdiction (Vendor Favorable)
This agreement and any disputes, including non-contractual claims, will be governed by the laws of the state where the vendor is located, excluding conflict of law principles and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and, if applicable, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. The state and federal courts in the vendor's county will have exclusive jurisdiction over any actions related to this agreement. Both parties agree to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.
## Headings and Construction
The headings of clauses, sub-clauses, and parts in this agreement are for ease of reference only and do not influence its interpretation. Ambiguities in this agreement will be interpreted impartially, regardless of the drafter. The terms "this agreement," "hereof," "hereunder," and similar expressions apply to the whole agreement, not specific sections. The words "include," "including," and similar terms in this agreement imply "without limitation."
## Independent Contractors
This agreement does not establish a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party has the authority to obligate or bind the other party without their prior written consent.
## Informal Dispute Resolution
Except as stated in Section X [injunctive relief provision], before starting any legal action, the parties must try to informally settle any dispute, including non-contractual claims, that stem from or are connected to this agreement.

## Jury Waiver
Each party gives up their right to a jury trial in any disagreement stemming from or connected to this Agreement.

## Non-Exclusive Relationship (Customer Favorable)
This agreement does not create an exclusive relationship. Vendor recognizes that Customer may engage, and reserves the right to continue to engage, other vendors for similar products or services. To the extent reasonably requested by Customer, Vendor will collaborate with Customer's other vendors to facilitate their fulfillment of obligations to Customer.


## Non-solicitation (Vendor Favorable)
During the term of a statement of work and for one year after its expiration or termination, in order to help ensure workforce stability and minimize business disruption, both parties agree not to solicit employees from each other who played a key role in the statement of work. However, the preceding restriction does not prevent either party from using public advertisements or search firms, as long as these are not specifically aimed at the other party or its employees. In addition, hiring individuals who respond to these general recruitment efforts is permitted.

## No Third Party Beneficiaries
Only the parties to this agreement and their successors and permitted assigns have the right to enforce this agreement.

## Notices
Notices required by this agreement must be in writing and sent to the address on the agreement's signature page, or to an updated address provided by a party in a notice delivered in the same manner. A notice is considered received when it is delivered in person, sent by certified or registered U.S. Mail with a return receipt, or sent through a major overnight commercial delivery service.

## Notices (Vendor Favorable)
Notices must sent using first class mail, airmail, or an overnight courier service to the address provided for the relevant party, and they will be considered received upon actual receipt. Notices to Customer may be sent to the email address associated with the account, and they will be considered delivered when sent.

## Order of Precedence
If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this agreement and those in an order form, this agreement's terms and conditions will take precedence. However, this rule does not apply if the conflict concerns pricing, payment terms, or other terms specific to the product(s) or services set forth in the order form. In those cases, the terms and conditions of the order form will prevail.

## Publicity
Neither party may publicly disclose this agreement or use the other party's name, logo, or trademarks in any public statements or promotional materials without prior written permission from a senior representative of the other party.

## Relationship of the Parties

The parties to this agreement are independent contractors. This agreement does not establish a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship between them. Neither party has the power to legally bind the other or incur obligations on their behalf without obtaining prior written consent from the other party.

## Severability
If a court with the authority to do so determines that any part of this agreement cannot be enforced or is invalid, that specific part will be adjusted to the smallest extent required in order for the rest of this agreement to continue to be valid and enforceable.

## Subcontractors (Customer Favorable)
Vendor may not subcontract any of its obligations in this agreement without the prior written consent of Customer. If Customer permits Vendor to subcontract, Vendor will remain the primary party responsible for fulfilling the terms of this agreement and will be accountable for ensuring that its subcontractors adhere to Vendor's obligations under this agreement.

## Subcontractors (Vendor Favorable)
Vendor may use subcontractors to perform services under this agreement, but Vendor remains responsible for: (a) the subcontractors complying with the terms of this agreement, and (b) the overall service provided meeting the requirements of this agreement.

## U.S. Federal Government Users (Vendor Favorable)
The software was created entirely with private funds and is classified as commercial computer software and related documentation under the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation and its agency-specific additions.

## Waiver
No party will be considered to have waived any rights or obligations under this agreement due to their conduct, inaction, or delay in enforcing these rights or obligations. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party granting the waiver.
