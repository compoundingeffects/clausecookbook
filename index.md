# Welcome to Clause Cookbook

The purpose of this website is to streamline the process of drafting technology transaction contracts by providing a repository of contract clauses in clear, accessible English. 

The universe of contracts you’re likely to encounter in the technology transactions space generally fall into the following categories:

- **Confidential Information:** This encompasses nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) tailored to either protect the interests of the disclosing party, the receiving party, or both parties when mutual confidentiality is involved.

- **Personal Data:** Here, one can find standard privacy policies for websites or mobile apps, along with information security addenda for customer or vendor agreements.

- **End User & Vendor Relationships:** This category includes terms applicable to individual end users (contrasted with corporate entities), like terms of service, use, or end user license agreements.

- **Enterprise Customer & Vendor Relationships:** This section includes agreements for product evaluations, sales, or licenses, as well as service contracts. More specifically, product evaluation agreements cover the assessment of software, data, hardware, or a combination of all three. Product licenses and sales encompass software, data, or content licensing, hardware purchases, or product manufacturing and supply. Service agreements are generally divided into consulting and outsourcing, with consulting typically governed by professional services agreements that may favor either the customer or vendor. Outsourcing agreements, less common than consulting agreements, involve a vendor managing a portion of the customer’s operations and can be subject to extensive negotiation.

- **Partnerships:** This encompasses referral agreements and distribution agreements for one's own products, a partner's products, a third party's products, or all of the above.

- **Joint Development:** Here, joint development agreements outline the collaborative effort's nature and detail the intellectual property rights associated with both the jointly developed and separately developed inputs and outputs.

In short, the goal of this website is to equip users with the necessary tools to create fair, clear, and effective contracts in the tech industry.
