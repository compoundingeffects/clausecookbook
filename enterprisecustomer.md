This section contains clauses favorable to the customer.
#### Bankruptcy (Escrowed Materials)
*This clause aims to safeguard the customer's interests and access to escrowed materials in the event of the vendor's bankruptcy, ensuring that the customer's rights under the license and escrow agreements are preserved.*

Vendor recognizes that the escrow agreement supplements the license agreement, per Section 365(n) of Title 11, United States Code (the “**Bankruptcy Code**”). If Vendor, acting as a debtor-in-possession or through a bankruptcy trustee (collectively referred to as “**Trustee**”), rejects either the license agreement or this escrow agreement during bankruptcy proceedings, Customer has the right, as specified in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, to maintain its rights under both agreements. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding initiated by or against Vendor, the Trustee will not interfere with Customer's rights as stipulated in both the license agreement and the escrow agreement. This includes Customer's right to receive the materials held in escrow. This obligation remains unless and until the license agreement is formally rejected. If the Trustee rejects the license agreement or the escrow agreement and Customer opts to retain its rights under these agreements, the Trustee is required, upon receiving a written request from Customer, to provide the escrowed materials to Customer.

#### Bankruptcy (Licensed Materials)
*This clause is designed to protect the customer's access to licensed material in the event of the vendor's bankruptcy, ensuring continuity and security in the customer's use of the licensed material.* 

For the purposes of Section 365(n) of Title 11, United States Code (the “**Bankruptcy Code**”), all rights and licenses provided to Customer by Vendor in this agreement are classified as licenses of rights to "intellectual property" as defined in Section 101(56) of the Bankruptcy Code. Customer, as the holder of these rights, retains the ability to fully exercise all of its rights and elections as provided under the Bankruptcy Code. In the event that Vendor enters into bankruptcy proceedings, Customer is entitled to either a complete duplicate of the intellectual property or full access to it. This includes all forms and embodiments of the intellectual property. If Vendor begins bankruptcy proceedings, Customer may request this intellectual property. Vendor must provide it promptly unless it decides to continue fulfilling all of its obligations under this agreement. If Vendor does not provide the intellectual property following the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings and chooses not to continue its obligations under this agreement, Customer may request the intellectual property upon the rejection of this agreement in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings.

#### Escrow Agreement
*The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the customer can access the source code of the licensed software if the vendor ceases operations, faces financial difficulties, breaches the agreement, or undergoes significant ownership changes.*

Upon the delivery of the Software to Customer, both parties will execute a software escrow agreement, and Vendor will provide the escrow agent with a complete and up-to-date version of all the source code for the Software. Following this initial delivery to the escrow agent, Vendor must also provide the escrow agent the source code for every update, release, or improvement to the Software within five days of providing these to Customer. Additionally, Vendor will provide the escrow agent an updated version of all the source code at least once every calendar year. The source code held in escrow will be released to Customer if any of the following events occur: a) Vendor stops operating, or is unable or unwilling to support the Software; b) Vendor declares bankruptcy, faces bankruptcy proceedings, reassigns assets to creditors, or appoints a bankruptcy trustee or receiver; c) Vendor breaches any obligations under this agreement and does not resolve the breach within the specified time; or d) there is a change in the control of Vendor, such as a sale of substantially all of its assets, a merger, an exchange of shares, or a sale of a controlling interest in Vendor's capital stock.

#### Escrow Agreement Beneficiary
*This clause allows the customer to become a third-party beneficiary to the escrow agreement, ensuring they can access the software's source code if the vendor fails to maintain the software as obligated.*

At Customer's request, it may become a third-party beneficiary to the escrow agreement between Vendor and the escrow agent. To do this, Customer must sign a form of acknowledgement in the form attached to this agreement. Vendor will provide the escrow agent with the Software's source code, and as stated in the escrow agreement, the escrow agent will release the source code to Customer if Vendor fails or is unable to support the Software in breach of Vendor's obligations under this agreement. Customer will pay all fees charged by the escrow agent for adding and maintaining Customer as a beneficiary and for all other fees payable by Customer as a beneficiary under the escrow agreement. Upon delivery of the source code to Customer in compliance with the provisions of the escrow agreement, Vendor grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable right, free of charge, to use the source code during the term of this agreement to modify the Software solely to meet the specific warranty and service obligations of Vendor under this agreement. 

### Software (Vendor-Favorable Terms)
This section contains clauses favorable to the vendor.
#### Audit Rights
*This clause grants the vendor the right to independently audit the customer's relevant financial records annually to ensure accurate payments, with stipulations for minimal business disruption and the customer's responsibility for underpayment and audit costs in cases of significant discrepancies.*

Vendor has the right, at its own expense, to direct an independent certified public accounting firm to inspect and audit the accounting and sales books and records of Customer that are relevant to verifying the accuracy of the amounts owed to Vendor by Customer. The preceding right is subject to the following: (a) the inspection and audit will be conducted at Customer's place of business during regular business hours with three days prior notice, (b) the inspection and audit will conducted in a manner that does not interfere with Customer’s normal business activities, and (c) the number of audits is limited to once per calendar year. If any inspection or audit discloses an underpayment, Customer will pay the amount owed to Vendor within 30 days of notice of the disclosure of underpayment. In addition, Customer will promptly pay all reasonable fees and expenses related to any inspection and audit that reveals a deficiency of 5% or more. Customer will keep and make available all books of account and records for five years after the termination or expiration of this agreement.

#### Acceptance Procedures (Aggressive)
#### Acceptance Procedures (Middle Ground)
*The purpose of the clause is to establish a formal process for the customer to test and either accept or reject deliverables provided by the vendor, with provisions for rectification of deficiencies and the right to terminate the agreement and obtain a refund if the deliverables consistently fail to meet agreed specifications.*

When Vendor decides it is time to begin acceptance testing for a specific deliverable, it must inform Customer in writing. Customer then has a period of sixty days, starting from the date of Vendor's notification, to evaluate if the developed programs meet the specifications agreed upon in writing by both parties. Before or on the last day of this acceptance period, Customer must inform Vendor in writing if the programs perform satisfactorily and are accepted. If Customer does not notify Vendor in writing of the program's satisfactory performance and acceptance, Customer will be assumed to have accepted the programs. However, if Customer identifies that the programs do not meet the approved specifications before the end of the acceptance period, it must provide Vendor with a written Notice of Rejection, explaining in detail the reasons for this rejection. Upon receiving a Notice of Rejection, Vendor is responsible for examining and rectifying the noted deficiencies at its own expense. After these corrections are made, the acceptance testing process will be repeated until Customer accepts the programs. If, after one repetition of this process, the programs still do not meet the specifications, Customer has the right to end the agreement by sending a written notice to Vendor and is entitled to a full refund of all fees paid to Vendor.
#### Conflicting Obligations
*The purpose of this clause is to prevent the vendor from improperly using or revealing confidential information or trade secrets obtained from its current or past clients or other entities with whom it has a confidentiality agreement.*

Vendor must not use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets belonging to a former or current client, customer, or any other individual or entity with whom Vendor has an agreement or obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the information obtained.

#### Expenses
*This clause specifies that Customer will reimburse Vendor for necessary and reasonable expenses related to the services, provided they have prior written approval, and clarifies that Vendor is responsible for any other expenses.*

For the satisfactory completion of the services outlined in this agreement, Customer will reimburse Vendor for actual and reasonable expenses incurred directly in relation to these services. These expenses, not including any overhead charges, will be reimbursed only if Customer has given prior written approval. Vendor bears responsibility for all other expenses.
### Consulting (Vendor-Favorable Terms)
#### Acceptance Procedures
#### Expenses
*This clause ensures that Vendor is reimbursed for legitimate service-related expenses by  Customer, subject to prior approval, and allows Vendor the discretion to invoice these expenses in advance.*

Customer will reimburse Vendor for all expenses actually incurred in the performance of the services. These expenses will be reimbursed only if Customer has given prior written approval. Customer will pay these expenses promptly after Vendor's expenditure and notification to Customer. Additionally, Vendor, using reasonable discretion, may issue an invoice to Customer in advance for these reimbursable expenses.

#### Export
*This clause requires the customer to comply with U.S. and international laws regarding the export and re-export of certain items by not proceeding with those actions without the proper governmental approvals.*

Customer acknowledges and agrees that U.S. laws and regulations may restrict the export and re-export of certain commodities and technical data.  Customer will not export or re-export the products or deliverables in any form without first obtaining all appropriate U.S. and foreign government licenses and permissions.
